<h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>This page is all bout me</h2>
<p> Hi my name is Brandon. I'm an IT student specializing in  Management Information Systems. I might be an outlier in the class but my passion has always been design and creating.</p> 
<ol>
<li>I enjoy working on albums with friends (even though I don't know how to play any instruments)</li>
<li>I love to take photos on film. </li>

<li>One of the best things to do on my free time is just listen to a bunch of music, it can be any genre. </li>
</ol>
<p>Below I'm going to leave a photo I recently took at a DJ show in Brooklyn.</p>
